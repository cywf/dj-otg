# Concept 

MacOS hosted on a server, running:
- serato 
- rekordbox
- OBS
- Accessable via browser
- "DJ through your browser"
- Use raspberry pi 4 to run the drivers for board compatability
- buy pioneer dj controller ddj-s1 driver's (cheap (150/avg per))

I'm trying to test out a concept idea, I want to know what you think; and if possible, a code example of deploying this via Terraform:

```md
# MacOS hosted on a server, running:
- Serato DJ Pro (DJ Software)
- Rekordbox (DJ Software)
- OBS (live streaming software)
- Accessible via browser ("DJ through your browser") - (SaaS)
- Use raspberry pi 4 to run the drivers for board compatibility - (product to go with SaaS)
- Ableton Live
```
How could I do this? I was thinking the following could be of potential use for us:

```md
# Tools, languages, OS's, ect.
- Kubernetes (to deploy applications in clusters)
- Helm Charts (mange cluster application dependancies)
- Docker (containerization)
- Terraform (to deploy everything all at once, then update / patch / upgrade via VCS)
- WordPress (launch 10 SEO websites promoting DJ platform)
- Zerotier (our network architecture)
```

### AI

Based on the information provided, here is a possible architecture and Terraform deployment plan:

Architecture
To deploy this setup, we will need a server running MacOS and a Raspberry Pi 4 connected to the network. The MacOS server will host Serato DJ Pro, Rekordbox, OBS, and Ableton Live. These applications will be containerized using Docker, and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm Charts. The DJ software will be accessible via a web interface, which will be hosted on a separate SaaS platform. To allow the Raspberry Pi 4 to run the drivers for board compatibility, we will use Zerotier to create a secure network tunnel between the server and the Raspberry Pi.

Here is a diagram of the architecture:

# Terraform Deployment Plan

Here is a possible Terraform deployment plan for this architecture:

1. Provision a MacOS server with the required hardware specifications.
2. Install Docker and Kubernetes on the server.
3. Deploy a Kubernetes cluster on the server.
4. Install Helm on the server.
5. Create Helm Charts for each DJ software application.
6. Containerize each DJ software application using Docker.
7. Deploy the DJ software applications to the Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
8. Configure a separate SaaS platform to host the web interface for the DJ software.
9. Use Zerotier to create a secure network tunnel between the server and the Raspberry Pi 4.
10. Connect the Raspberry Pi 4 to the Zerotier network and install the required drivers.

This deployment plan can be executed using Terraform to provision and configure the infrastructure, and can be version controlled to manage updates and changes. Here is an example of how the Terraform configuration could look like:

```tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

// this is the server image that will run all of the applications
resource "aws_instance" "macos_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "my_key_pair"

  tags = {
    Name = "macos-server"
  }
}

// Install Kubernetes - containerization mgmt
resource "null_resource" "install_docker_kubernetes" {
  depends_on = [aws_instance.macos_server]

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh",
      "sudo sh get-docker.sh",
      "sudo usermod -aG docker $USER",
      "sudo curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl",
      "sudo chmod +x ./",
      "sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/"
    ]
    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "my_user"
      private_key = file("path/to/my/key.pem")
      host        = aws_instance.macos_server.public_ip
    }
  }
}

// Install Serato DJ Pro - dj software
resource "helm_release" "serato_dj_pro" {
  chart      = "my_repo/serato_dj_pro"
  name       = "serato-dj-pro"
  repository = "https://my-repo.com/charts"

  set {
    name  = "database.host" // ----- TODO: create variable 
    value = "mydb.example.com" // ----- TODO: create variable 
  }

  set {
    name  = "database.password" // ----- TODO: create variable
    value = "mysecretpassword" // ----- TODO: create variable
  }

  namespace = "dj-software" // ----- TODO: create variable
}

// Install Rekordbox - dj software
resource "helm_release" "rekordbox" {
  chart      = "my_repo/rekordbox"
  name       = "rekordbox"
  repository = "https://my-repo.com/charts"

  namespace = "dj-software" // ----- TODO: create variable
}

// Install OBS - live streaming software
resource "helm_release" "obs" {
  chart      = "my_repo/obs"
  name       = "obs"
  repository = "https://my-repo.com/charts"

  namespace = "dj-software" // ----- TODO: create variable
}

// Install Ableton Live - music production software
resource "helm_release" "ableton_live" {
  chart      = "my_repo/ableton_live"
  name       = "ableton-live"
  repository = "https://my-repo.com/charts"

  namespace = "dj-software" // ----- TODO: create variable
}

resource "saas_platform" "web_interface" {
  // Terraform code to provision SaaS platform
}

resource "zerotier_network" "dj_network" {
  // Terraform code to create Zerotier network
}

resource "zerotier_member" "raspberry_pi" {
  // Terraform code to join Raspberry Pi to Zerotier network
}
```

Note that this is just an example and the actual Terraform code will need to be customized based on the specific requirements of the project. In addition, the Helm Charts for each DJ software application will need to be created, and the SaaS platform and Zerotier network will need to be provisioned separately using their respective Terraform providers.
